        <p>In the Pokémon games, the Safari Zone is a fun game where the player tries to catch a variety of Pokémon in different areas, but without battling them with their own. There are 4 main
          options when encountering Pokémon, but can vary from different game versions: throw a pokéball, throw bait and/or mud, or run. Throwing bait or mud can increase and/or decrease catch and flee rates
          in a wild encounter, among other factors that can influence them as well, so this game is more reliant on hoping the RNG(Randon Number Generator) is in the player's favor. A player's time in the Safari Zone ends when they reach a certain
          number of steps, typically around 500-600 steps.

        <p>My text-based Safari Zone asks the user for certain commands via the terminal to play the game. Although it does have similar mechanics to the original Safari Zone, it's a lot
          more scaled down and obviously doesn't have the classic Game Boy graphics, but it does use tools such as <em>ANSI colors</em> and the use of <em>Thread.sleep()</em> to help add some
          game-like effect. The game ends if the user meets 100 steps or if they have run out of pokéballs to use. Now because the 
          original Safari Zone uses a lot of RNG, I use a lot of Java's Random class to somewhat emulate the RNG from the original games.</p>

        <p>The game starts by printing out some set-up information, and then prompting the user to choose a region, once they do, it will read a 75 line <em>.txt</em> file based on the user's selected region that will populate
          each distinct zone, my game has 15 Pokémon per zone with 5 zones total. The user enters a new zone by meeting a random target value of steps between the interval [10-20] and is met with a brief 
          description of the zone and list of potential Pokémon that they can encounter. I have implemented 4 options: moving around has the user take a step which will result in a 50% chance of a battle, looking has the user see 
          if there is an item(pokéball, bait, mud, or berries) they can pick up, stats will show helpful information to the user, and quitting will end the game early. The user starts with 
          30 pokéballs, 5 berries, 20 bait and mud each, and 10 "display uses".

        <p>I have added some small mechanics to my version of the game, when the user encounters a wild Pokémon, they're asked if they want to display catch/flee rates. This is
          a very beneficial tool to use when catching Pokémon in the Safari Zone as the user can easily determine if they have to use other items, such as mud or bait, to catch the opposing Pokémon. 
          However, they're limited to 10 uses only, so they have to use these "display uses" wisely. For catch rates, I have it so that a random number on the interval [0-4] will either cause the opponent to break out of the user's pokéball 
          (numbers 0-2) or will result in a successful catch (numbers 3-4). For flee rates, for a random number on the interval [0-5], 0-3 will stay in battle and 4-5 will cause the opponent to run from battle. 
          The user can manipulate the catch/flee rate in their favor using mud, bait, and berries. Mud increases the opponent's catch rate, but it also increases their flee rate. Bait decreases flee rate, but it also decreases the catch rate. 
          Berries are a lot more beneficial, as they increase the opponent's catch rate and decrease the flee rate. Because of these items, for a random number on the interval [0-7] when looking, 0-1 gets a pokéball, 2-3 for some bait, 4-5 for some mud, 6 for a berry, and 7 is no item.
          Notice that berries are meant to be somewhat rare in this implementation compared to bait, mud, or pokéballs. I have also implemented that using more pokéballs in battle will cause the catch rate to decrease and the flee rate to increase, so that the battle isn't too long.

          There is also information on what Pokémon the user caught and the time spent in the Safari Zone.
