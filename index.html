        <p>In the Pokémon games, the Safari Zone is a fun game where the player tries to catch a variety Pokémon in different areas, but without battling them with their own. There are 4 main
          options when encountering Pokémon in this area: throw a pokéball, throw bait or mud, or run. Throwing bait or mud can increase and/or decrease catch and flee rates
          in a battle, so this game is more reliant on hoping the RNG(Randon Number Generator) is in the player's favor. A player's time in the Safari Zone ends when they reach a certain
          number of steps, typically around 500-600 steps.

        <p>My text-based Safari Zone uses asks the user for certain commands via the terminal. Although it does have similar mechanics to the original Safari Zone, it's a lot
          more scaled down and obviously doesn't have the classic Game Boy graphics, but it does use <em>ANSI colors</em> and the use of <em>Thread.sleep()</em> to help add some
          game-like effects to my version of this game. This game ends if the user has hit 100 steps or if they have run out of pokéballs to use. Now because the 
          original Safari Zone uses a lot of RNG, I use a lot of Java's Random class.</p>

        <p>The game starts by printing out some information, and then prompting the user to choose a region, once they do, it will read a 75 line <em>.txt</em> file that will populate
          each zone, my game has 15 Pokémon per zone with 5 zones total. The user enters a new zone by meeting a random target value of steps between the interval [10-20] and is met with a brief 
          description of the zone that they will enter. I have implemented 4
          options: moving around has the user take a step which will result in a 50% chance of a battle, looking has the user see if there is an item(pokéball, bait, mud, or berries) they can 
          pick up, stats will show helpful information to the user, and quitting will end the game early. The user starts with 30 pokéballs, 5 berries, 20 bait and mud each, and 10 "display uses".

        <p>I have added some small mechanics to my version of the game, when the user encounters a wild Pokémon, they're asked if they want to display catch/flee rates. This is
          a very beneficial tool to use when catching Pokémon in the Safari Zone as the user can easily determine if they have to use other items, such as mud or bait, to catch the opponent. 
          However, they're limited to 10 uses only, so they have to use these "display uses" wisely. For catch rates, I have it so that a random number on the interval [0-4], 0-2 will cause the opponent to break out of the user's pokéball and 3-4 will result in a successful catch.
          For flee rates, for a random number on the interval [0-5], 0-3 will stay in battle and 4-5 will cause the opponent to run from battle. The user can change the catch/flee rate using mud, bait, and berries.
          Mud increases the opponent's catch rate, but it also increases their flee rate. Bait decreases flee rate, but it also decreases the catch rate. Berries are a lot more beneficial, as
          they increase the opponent's catch rate and decrease the flee rate. Because of these items, for a random number on the interval [0-7] when looking, 0-1 gets a pokéball, 2-3 for some bait, 4-5 for some mud, 6 for a berry, and 7 is no item.
          Berries are meant to be somewhat uncommon/rare as they're the most beneficial in battle second to a pokéball.

        <p>At any point during the game and at the end of the game, the user's stats is displayed, which shows helpful information such as how many pokéballs they have left orhow many steps they've taken, etc. When the game ends,
          there is also a line that shows the user how much time they spent in the Safari Zone, which is another extra mechanic I added to my version.
